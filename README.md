# Bubble Sort in C with pointers swapping

This project is a simple bubble sort written in C language, but the algorithm uses pointers only to swap between the varibles in the array. In other words, it doesnâ€™t change the value of them, instead it's switching their pointers.
See the Example:

step1: 1 2 -10 100 8 5 

step2: 1 -10 2 100 8 5 

step3: 1 -10 2 8 100 5 

step4: -10 1 2 8 100 5 

step5: -10 1 2 8 5 100 

step6: -10 1 2 5 8 100 

step7: -10 1 2 5 8 100
